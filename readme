Description: 
This is theme nearly looks like macOS, with script which can set wallpaper for your desktop and simultaneously set same wallpaper on lock screen and login screen with blur effect like on macOS. In attachment you will find file ubuntu.css, where injected some changes, to make your login screen and lock screen looks more like mac OS.

ATTENTION: TESTED ONLY ON UBUNTU 17.10 with GDM3 (xorg). (Any other OS based on Linux didn't tested!!!)

INSTRUCTION:

1. First of all you have to unpuck archive and change your ubuntu.css file (/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.css). changes in attachments.
# sudo cp /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.css /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/ubuntu.bak
# sudo cp ~/Downloads/ "folder with unpacked files' /ubuntu.css /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/
# sudo chmod 777 /usr/share/backgrounds/

2. Second thing is, set nautilus script by copying script it self "SetAsWallpaper" to '/home/click/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/' 
then you have to change access for your script by "sudo chmod +x SetAsWallpaper" and enter root password. 
Restart your nautilus in terminal by command nautilus -q, or killall nautilus.

3. Now you just choose your image right click mouse button you will see script and "SetAsWallpaper" just click on it, this is it.

4. It`s last step, and you have to do it just once. At the desktop right click on screen select "Change Background" then "Lock Screen" and "Pictures", find there your blurred image and choose it. Just once!

Enjoy!

Addition:

If your interface another language, "not English" and text inside buttons don't fit in, you have to insert little changes in ubuntu.css

1)
1717# /*login size prompt input*/
1722# width: 190px; /* change width 190px to size what more or less will be close to 
                       size of your text inside buttons. Just try change width! */

2)
1591# /* Avatar Auth Dialogs & Screen Shield */
1594# margin: 0 0 0 60px; /* change margin 60px to centered your avatar */
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Enjoy!
